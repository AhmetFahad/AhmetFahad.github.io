This portfolio is an atempt to showcase some of the notebooks I made for data-science and machine-learning related projects.
The notebooks are sorted by its categories.

## Classification projects.

### The Titanic disaster.

[Link](https://github.com/AhmetFahad/AhmetFahad.github.io/blob/master/kaggle%20titanic.ipynb)

This was my first Kaggle competetion that I participated in. The objective was to predict the passengers who survived based on a set of features. A thorough description of the features is provided on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

### Students' performance in exams.

[Link](https://github.com/AhmetFahad/AhmetFahad.github.io/blob/master/students-performance-in-exams.ipynb)

[The dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams) is the scores of math, wrtiting and reading secured by students in a high school in the United States accompanied with other features like parental level of education, test preparation course, etc. A brief description for the features provided in the notebook. The objective i chose was to predict the outcome of the tests (Pass of Fail) for a subset of students.

## Classification with neural networks.

### Chest X-Ray Images classification.

[Link](https://github.com/AhmetFahad/AhmetFahad.github.io/blob/master/Classifying%20images%20of%20lungs.ipynb)

[The dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) is a set of Chest X-Rays images for patients with Pneumonia and other normal chest X-Rays images. The dataset is organized into 3 folders (train, test, val) and contains subfolders for each image category (Pneumonia/Normal). The objective of the notebook is to classify each image whether the patient does have Pneumonia or not by using 3 CNN layers.

## Clustering.

### Mall Customer Segmentation.

[Link](https://github.com/AhmetFahad/AhmetFahad.github.io/blob/master/mall-customer-segment-k-means.ipynb)

[The dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python) contains information belongs to customers of a market. The info consists of a number of features like spending score, income, etc. The features are explained in the data link. The objective is to segment the customers into a number of groups based on income and spending score.

## NLP.

### Onion or not.

[Link](https://github.com/AhmetFahad/AhmetFahad.github.io/blob/master/onion-or-not-nlp.ipynb)

[Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/chrisfilo/onion-or-not) of The Onion articles and real "Onion-like" news articles from the subreddit r/NotTheOnion. The Onion articles are labeled 1 and the r/NotTheOnion (A subreddit for real articles that are odd enough to make the readers question if they are real or not.) articles are labeled 0. The objective is to detect which articles are Onion's and which are real news.

## Regression.

### Predicting house prices.

[Link](https://github.com/AhmetFahad/AhmetFahad.github.io/blob/master/predecting-house-prices-with-random-tree-forests.ipynb)

The second [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) on kaggle that i participated in. The dataset comes with 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa with the sale price. Check the competition link for a full describtion of features. The objective is to build a machine learning model to predict the sale prices for a set of houses based on the data we have.

## Time series RNN.

### Predicting future sales.

[Link](https://github.com/AhmetFahad/AhmetFahad.github.io/blob/master/Kaggle_predict_future_sales.ipynb)

Another kaggle [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales). The dataset is the daily historical sales data for a number of shopes. The competition link provides a full describtion for the files and features. The objective is to forecast the total amount of products sold in every shop for the test set.
